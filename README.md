## Rock Paper Scissors | Roast My Code

Hey there! :wave: This repository is an implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game. 

My goal with this code is to publish a post over on DEV.to and let people roast it, and improve it if they feel like it!

## Getting Started

1. Clone repo 
2. Change diretory to the cloned repo
3. Install deps `npm install`
4. Run the game `npm start`
5. Code starts at `main.ts`
6. Roast the code!

## How to roast?
Head over to DEV.to, and leave a coment on the [post](https://dev.to/nombrekeff/roast-the-code-1-rock-paper-scissors-2fdl). If you want to, you can also send in a PR with your proposed changes here!
